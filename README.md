[![Twitter Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/splitsoftware.svg?style=social&label=Follow&maxAge=1529000)](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=splitsoftware)

## Overview
This Provider is designed to allow the use of OpenFeature with Split, the platform for controlled rollouts, serving features to your users via the Split feature flag to manage your complete customer experience.

## Getting started
Below is a simple example that describes the instantiation of the Split Provider. Please see the [OpenFeature Documentation](https://docs.openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/evaluation-api) for details on how to use the OpenFeature SDK.

### Add the Split provider

```sh
npm install @splitsoftware/openfeature-web-split-provider
```

### Confirm peer dependencies are installed
```sh
npm install @splitsoftware/splitio-browserjs
npm install @openfeature/web-sdk
```

### Register the Split provider with OpenFeature using splitFactory
```js
import { OpenFeature } from '@openfeature/web-sdk';
import { SplitFactory } from '@splitsoftware/splitio-browserjs';
import { OpenFeatureSplitProvider } from '@splitsoftware/openfeature-web-split-provider';

const splitFactory = SplitFactory({
  core: {
    authorizationKey: 'CLIENT_SIDE_SDK_KEY',
    key: 'TARGETING_KEY'
  }
});

const provider = new OpenFeatureSplitProvider(splitFactory);

// Register provider and wait for the default SDK client for 'TARGETING_KEY' to be ready
await OpenFeature.setProviderAndWait(provider);

const client = OpenFeature.getClient();
```

## Use of OpenFeature with Split
After the initial setup you can use OpenFeature according to their [documentation](https://docs.openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/evaluation-api/).

One important note is that the Split Provider **requires a targeting key** to be set. Often times this should be set when evaluating the value of a flag by [setting an EvaluationContext](https://docs.openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/evaluation-context) which contains the targeting key. An example flag evaluation is
```js
const context: EvaluationContext = {
  targetingKey: 'TARGETING_KEY',
  trafficType: 'account'
};
await OpenFeature.setContext(context)
```

## Evaluate with details
Use the get*Details(...) APIs to get the value and rich context (variant, reason, error code, metadata). This provider includes the Split treatment config as a raw JSON string under flagMetadata["config"]

```js
const booleanTreatment = client.getBooleanDetails('boolFlag', false);

const config = booleanTreatment.flagMetadata.config;
```

## Evaluate with attributes
Evaluation attributes must be set in context before evaluation

```js
const context: EvaluationContext = {
  targetingKey: 'TARGETING_KEY',
  trafficType: 'account',
  // Evaluation attributes:
  plan: 'premium',
  coupon: 'WELCOME10'
};
await OpenFeature.setContext(context);
const booleanTreatment = client.getBooleanDetails('boolFlag', false);
```

## Tracking

To use track(eventName, context, details) you must provide:

- A non-blank `eventName`.
- A context with:
  - `targetingKey` (non-blank).
  - `trafficType` (string, e.g. "user" or "account", "user" by default).

Optional:

- details with:
  - `value`: numeric event value (defaults to 0).
  - `properties`: map of attributes (prefer primitives: string/number/boolean/null).

Example:
```js
const context = { targetingKey: 'user-123', trafficType: 'account' }
const details = { value: 19.99, properties: { plan: 'pro', coupon: 'WELCOME10' }}

await client.setContext(context)
client.track('checkout.completed', details)
```
